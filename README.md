- I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com/)
- My current interests in Scientific Computing include (see [here](https://pearu.github.io/) for technical blogs):
  - Theory of Sparse Arrays, in particular, PyTorch sparse tensors support
  - Interoperability of Array-like objects from various software
  - Algorithms and Implementations
  - Support Fortran 90 TYPE construct in F2Py
- I have initiated and co-authored a number of open source projects with the following highlights:
  - [RBC](https://github.com/xnd-project/rbc) - Remote Backend Compiler
  - [F2Py](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/) - Fortran to Python interface generator [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1504/IJCSE.2009.029165), ships with [NumPy](https://numpy.org) [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2649-2)
  - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) - open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0686-2)

  and contributed to a number of open source projects ([OmniSci](https://www.omnisci.com/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), [XND](https://github.com/xnd-project), [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/), etc).
